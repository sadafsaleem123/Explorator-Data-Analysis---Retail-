# Exploratory Data Analysis-Retail-

The code is about to explore the Retail's data. This is basically a Superstore's data in which I was supposed to find the weak and strong areas of that store. Using different visualization techniques, I have proved that if we focus more in California state in which the profit is relatively less in accordance to the sales then we can generate more revenue at the end. 

Other useful conclusions are as follow:
1. The sale of tables should be stopped as it is producing high loss. 
2. Bookcasses and suppliers are producing negligible loss so their price should be increased or sale should be stopped. 
3. For the central region we should definitely look into the furniture category as we are suffering most losses there. 
4. The supply of technology should be increased as it appears to be promising way to increase profits exponentially as all the regions are gaining high profit from it. 
5. Texas, Ohio, Illinois and Pennsylvania are incurring huge loss even when the sale is good and the main reason is huge discounts. 
6. The supply of technology should be increased as it appears to be promising way to increase profits.
